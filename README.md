# my-portfolio

I'm currently working on building an E-Portfolio using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The purpose of working on this project is to further imporve my current skills using the above technologies in order to confidently use them alongside more advance technologies, libraries and/or frameworks.

In the future, I will upgrade this into a React/Next.js application and have it deployed on Vercel.
